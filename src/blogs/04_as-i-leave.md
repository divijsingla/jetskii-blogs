It’s 2:30 a.m. while I’m writing this, and honestly, I didn’t plan to get this emotional about BLR. But here we are.

I came here for a couple of months, thinking it’d just be a break, a new city, some work, better weather and worse traffic. I didn’t expect to end up connecting so deeply with you.

I mastered the art of having small talk with random strangers, lol. Never thought I'd talk to a random Zepto delivery guy or the new caretaker who came to the building just 2 days ago and we'd both feel emotional together that I'm leaving BLR. We were not attached to each other, in fact we met for the first time, but in that brief moment, we must've felt something real. I think it was the love for the process, not the attachment to it.

I was able to tease random people, joke with waiters, asking to remove the service charge with zero shame, and find joy in the smallest things, maybe because, for once, I felt free. I felt present.

When I was leaving campus, I didn’t feel all this so deeply, maybe because we had the next goal figured out, move to a city and go to the job, move forward. But right now for me, I don't know what life has to serve next, and that uncertainty has made me appreciate the fact that yes, this could be one of the last times I'm spending time with the people I love. And this realisation has made me seek for freedom stronger than ever. Now, I am seeking, not just thinking, proactively, how can I do shit to keep everything together, friends, family and spend more time while completely being a part of this process, not getting attached to it. Being in the present, and experiencing the love for it. 

It can’t be these logistical nightmares that I miss out on spending time with people like you, who truly matter, people who have made me realise the love for the process, not for the outcome. In the end, it’s one life for all of us. This isn’t about attachment; it’s about experiencing that love for the process while I’m with you. I was present and aware. We weren't thinking about how the food at the restaurant we were going to will taste, we loved the walk. We didn't care about how beautiful the peak and the sunrise will look, we loved the trek. We were happy, because we were free, not conditioned to expectations. We experienced unconditional love, not for the walk, not for the restaurant, but for the process. 

You now might have heard this an enormous number of times from me, association matters. I couldn't have experienced this love with any random person. You are special.

If I ever do or have done something wrong, or if you’ve ever felt something wasn’t right, just talk to me. Don’t assume. Communicate. There’s nothing that clarity can’t fix.
