<blockquote style="color: #000000;">
Why can’t I love?<br>
Is it really this complicated, or did I make it so?<br>
Why’s it so hard to feel something real,<br>
and so easy to fall for something that isn't<br>

I need help, but no one understands my situation<br>
Perhaps because to understand me completely, they have to be me<br>
I guess only I can help myself

<blockquote style="color: #000000;">
I'm a slave of my body, the society and perhaps luck<br>
Most probably, there is nothing original that I did or thought<br><br>
Think, if there is even one thing in your life that isn't because of body, society or circumstances, You're crazy.
