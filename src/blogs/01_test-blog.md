Right now I’m really into studying randomness and how equili
briums form in nature [[Atkin's](https://share.google/ha5GjfIspIe0WwjhO)].

I like studying randomness since childhood, but I actually realised my love for it when I did a course on Randomised Algorithms
(realised how impractical it is to use Dijkstra’s for calculating shortest paths).

Now I’ve realised that I never loved math or music,
it is always making sense out of absurdity that I enjoyed.
