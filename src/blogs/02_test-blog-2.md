Existence at its core is a dance between the true self and the ego. I know that sounds abstract, so I’ll try to break it down here. I would try my best not to make it a self-help ceremony. It will be more of me overthinking in public.

Let me first define what I mean when I say __existence__ and __true__

### Existence

Existence is "you" and what you observe. Call it your reality, or if you want to sound fancy, your “projected reality” (Imagine your eyes as projectors, rendering different scenes as a function of space and time). And since “existence” already sounds like I’m trying to start a TED Talk, so I'll use "universe" and "existence" interchangeably (~~to make things worse~~).

### True / Truth

Truth is consistent, objective, and independent of arbitrary conditions. I know this is not a __definition__ per se, these are traits of truth, but it's really hard to define truth, and you'll soon understand why. Truth is absolute: it does not change depending on perspective, location, or time.

1. **Why Truth Cannot Depend on Space or Time**

2. Suppose **S** is true at point A in space or at time T₁.  
3. If **S** changes when you move to point B or to time T₂, then **S** was not objectively true to begin with, it was only conditionally true.  
4. By definition, truth must be **independent of conditions**. If it varies with space or time, it becomes relative, not absolute.

5. __A corollary__ : We can't have two truths. 
6. __Another fun corollary__ : As there is only one truth, it has to be nothing, null and void (for lack of better words). _(I know it's a little hard to imagine, I'll write a separate blog on this)_

The irony is that everything we experience or imagine is trapped inside space and time, and truth is completely untouchable by all that. It has no start, no end; no birth, death; no physical coordinates. Basically anything and everything we can think of, is not true. Such a shame. That's why they call it mãya.
_Now you know why I was struggling while defining it._

Now that we're on the same page with these terms, let's go into -

### The Drama

The dance between true self and ego, where one is seeking unity, the other craving distinction seems to give rise to all experiences. Without this interplay, neither individuality nor the universe as we know it seems to exist.

This philosophical duality doesn’t feel like a mere abstract idea; it manifests everywhere, from our consciousness to the laws of physics.

Take mass, for instance. The very essence of mass in an object signifies the presence of Earth’s gravitational force acting upon it. This force opposes the thrust that propels the object upward. Yet, without mass, we cannot even accelerate an object. The same entity (mass) that causes an object to be pulled down is also essential for generating the force that lifts it up. (Here’s a generalized take beyond Earth: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/If-there-is-only-one-massive-object-and-no-other-will-there-be-gravity))

And friction is fundamental to walking. Though it acts opposite to the direction of motion, it is precisely what allows movement. Back in class 11, before I studied Newtonian physics in depth, I used to imagine myself sliding gracefully across a frictionless floor, but reality had other plans. Step on a frictionless surface and you don’t slide, you simply trip in place, unable to move forward at all.

### Opposition is Motion

It’s not just about gravity or friction, Opposition is the secret sauce of motion. A river flows because of the difference in height between its source and mouth, a pendulum swings because of the constant tug between gravity and tension, all speed, motion, and dynamism in the universe are born from the push and pull of opposites. Without resistance, there is no progress; without friction, no movement; without contrast in an image, there’s no figure at all, just a plain, featureless oneness… Well, you get the idea. Speed and movement don't exist without opposition. And existence, or universe as we know it, is constant dynamism. The interplay and the dance between opposite forces generate motion, and thus, the universe itself.

### Lemma

It is a good possibility that universe is a physical manifestation of the duality between ego and the true self. Realizing the true self would dissolve this duality and, consequently, the universe itself. Conversely, if the ego can counter the true self and completely overwhelm or engulf it, the universe will again dissolve and cease to exist. Both the ego and the true self must coexist for an individual to realize and comprehend the universe.

The tug-of-war between truth and untruth, or true self and ego, seems to realize the universe at a fundamental level. Its physical interpretations, like friction and walking or mass and rocket thrust, are what we observe and study as science.

### Absurdism

Perhaps the universe is not something “out there” to be fully understood, but something we witness through this constant interplay.  
And maybe, asking these questions: about who we are, why things move, and how opposites shape existence is itself one of the ways of appreciating the dance.
