Existence at its core is a dance between the true self and the ego. I know that sounds abstract, so I’ll try to break it down here.

Existence is "you" and what you observe. Call it your reality, or if you want to sound fancy, your “projected reality” (Imagine your eyes as projectors, rendering different scenes as a function of space and time). Hence, I'll use "universe" and "existence" interchangeably.

The dance between true self and ego, where one is seeking unity, the other craving distinction seems to give rise to all experiences. Without this interplay, neither individuality nor the universe as we know it could exist.

This philosophical duality doesn’t feel like a mere abstract idea; it manifests everywhere, from our consciousness to the laws of physics that govern the universe.

Take mass, for instance. The very essence of mass in an object signifies the presence of Earth’s gravitational force acting upon it. This force opposes the thrust that propels the object upward. Yet, without mass, we cannot even accelerate an object. The same entity (mass) that causes an object to be pulled down is also essential for generating the force that lifts it up. (Here’s a generalized take beyond Earth: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/If-there-is-only-one-massive-object-and-no-other-will-there-be-gravity))

And friction is fundamental to walking. Though it acts opposite to the direction of motion, it is precisely what allows movement. Back in class 11, before I studied Newtonian physics in depth, I used to imagine myself sliding gracefully across a frictionless floor, but reality had other plans. Step on a frictionless surface and you don’t slide, you simply trip in place, unable to move forward at all.

It’s not just about gravity or friction, Opposition is the secret sauce of motion. A river flows because of the difference in height between its source and mouth, a pendulum swings because of the constant tug between gravity and inertia, all speed, motion, and dynamism in the universe are born from the push and pull of opposites. Without resistance, there is no progress; without friction, no movement; without contrast… well, in an image, there’s no figure at all, just a plain, featureless oneness. You get the idea. Speed and movement don't exist without opposition. And existence, or universe as we know it, is constant dynamism. The interplay and the dance between these forces generate motion, and thus, the universe itself.

I'm not sure, but somehow feel that these all are physical manifestations of the duality between ego and the true self. Realizing the true self would dissolve this duality and, consequently, the universe itself. Conversely, if the ego can counter the true self and completely overwhelm or engulf it, the universe will again dissolve and cease to exist. Both the ego and the true self must coexist for an individual to realize and comprehend the universe.

The tug-of-war between truth and untruth, or true self and ego, seems to realize the universe at a fundamental level. Its physical interpretations, like friction and walking or mass and rocket thrust, are what we observe and study as science.

Perhaps the universe is not something “out there” to be fully understood, but something we witness through this constant interplay.  
And maybe, asking these questions: about who we are, why things move, and how opposites shape existence is itself one of the ways of appreciating the dance.

The chain of thought that led me write this stuff:

I read about the word "कृष्ण" being derived from "कर्षण" (Which then gives rise to the word आकर्षण or Attraction)  
यथा भ्राम्यत्ययो ब्रह्मन् स्वयमाकर्षसन्निधौ ।  
तथा मे भिद्यते चेतश्चक्रपाणेर्यद‍ृच्छया ॥

Vrittiya hamari aisi hai ki karengi to aatma (true self) ka virodh hi.

Aham pura zor lagata hai ki aatma me na milu, but uski antim prachann icha bhi aatmasth hona hi hai.

If opposing force hi na hota to Attraction (कृष्ण) won’t even be required.
