At the heart of existence lies a profound duality: the true self and the ego. The dance between these two, one seeking unity, the other craving distinction gives rise to all experience. Without this interplay, neither individuality nor the universe as we know it could exist.

This philosophical duality is not just an abstract idea; it manifests everywhere, from the depths of our consciousness to the laws of physics that govern the cosmos.

The essence of mass in an object signifies the presence of gravitational force acting upon it. This force works in opposition to the thrust that propels it upwards. However, we cannot even accelerate a massless object. Thus, the very force that pulls it down is also crucial for generating the force that lifts it up.

Similarly, if you attempt to walk on a frictionless surface, you'll find yourself tripping in place and unable to move at all. The same friction that acts against the direction in which you wish to walk is essential for movement.

This duality is what fundamentally realizes the entire universe. The universe is an eternal dynamism. But what gives rise to this movement or speed? It is the very presence of opposing forces. Just as a river flows because of the difference in height between its source and mouth, or a pendulum swings because of the constant tug between gravity and inertia, all speed, motion, and dynamism in the universe are born from the push and pull of opposites. Without resistance, there is no progress; without friction, no movement; without contrast, no change. The interplay and balance between these forces generate movement, and thus, the universe itself.

This duality stems from the core, where the ego and the true self represent two opposing entities. Realizing the true self would inevitably dissolve this duality and, consequently, the universe itself. Conversely, if the ego can counter the true self to the extent that it completely overwhelms and engulfs it, the world will again dissolve and cease to exist. 

Both the ego and the true self must coexist for an individual to comprehend the universe.

Dramas and folktales sometimes display this duality in terms of Good and Bad, Angels and Demons, or Fairies and Evils. True self is the truth and ego is the opposite. If the truth wins, the universe will end. And yes, if the ego wins, the universe will again have to end.

The tug-of-war between truth and untruth, or true self and ego, realizes the universe at a fundamental level. Its physical interpretations, like friction and walking or mass and rocket thrust, are what we observe and study as science.

Krishna (Karshan, Aakarshan, Attraction)

Vrittiya hamari aisi hai ki karengi to aatma (true self) ka virodh hi.

If opposing force hi na hota to Attraction (Krishna) wonâ€™t even be required.

Aham pura zor lagata hai ki aatma me na milu, but uski antim prachann icha bhi aatmasth hona hi hai.
