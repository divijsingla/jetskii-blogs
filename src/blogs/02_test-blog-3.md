<span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span> is that what keeps Eli awake at night and makes him daydream in the office. Eli doesn’t need motivation to pursue <span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span>. He feels the unease when he’s not doing it. Eli won’t have to chase <span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span>, it will come to him.

Eli doesn’t need a schedule to allocate time to <span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span>. Eli needs a schedule cause he hasn’t found his <span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;" >&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span> yet, or better, he’s not worthy enough.

Once upon a time, in the old days, he was worthy for it. In fact he was the best person who could pursue <span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span>. He was born to do it. As he grew older, he began to dilute his consciousness and the innate instincts inside him to conform to society's expectations of happiness. He accepted without question that happiness was found in achieving A, B, C, though he never truly understood what being happy meant. If Eli were truly happy, he wouldn’t be searching for the best café out there, a better job, or the best pants to match his top, let alone wait for the weekend to feel what he calls being happy.

<span style="background-color:#a05a2c; color:white;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;</span>. He will be happy when he finds that, what he was born to do.

Making schedule is a negative sum game. It gives you a delusion of happiness.
