<blockquote style="color: #000000;">
If getting close feels risky,<br>
and walking away feels safer,<br>
that’s usually love<br>
If you’re scared to attach,<br>
then it’s love.<br>
Nothing else feels dangerous<br>
and safe<br>
at the same time.

<blockquote style="color: #000000;">
Life gets tricky like that sometimes,<br>
makes you blur the places you once felt whole<br>
You start hiding from the good parts,<br>
start calling them mistakes<br>
Fooling yourself is never good

<blockquote style="color: #000000;">
Love is a state of being new, fresh, alive, <br>
untouched by past or future.<br>
It's rare to feel like that<br>
But it takes away the safety and makes you vulnerable<br>
hence people try to run away from that
