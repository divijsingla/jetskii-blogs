A friend of mine motivated me to think what causes the conflicts in our mind and how can we fix them. This is such a fundamental question. 

If we can sit and think our way through a conflict, that means the process to end that conflict was already somewhere in our mind, or atleast the basis to come up with the process to end it must've been in our mind. If we could identify those foundations, we could live a life with no conflicts, or at least, find our way through them with a bit more ease. I call it living with clarity.

Life, for most people, is a perpetual state of inner conflict. If you were absolutely certain of every action, every choice, with zero friction in thought <sub>_(that doesn’t mean you won’t reason, but that thought-level conflict about whether what you’re doing is right or not won’t happen)_</sub>, I don’t know what that life would look like, but it would definitely be the aftermath of immense clarity and self belief. And that, honestly, sounds like a good state to be in.

## Conflicts

Conflicts arise in our mind when it has choices to deal with. They are a direct consequence of multiple choices in the mind. If you have two choices and your mind evaluates, quite clearly, that one of those choices is absolute bullshit, the conflict would end. 

So the key is not fighting the conflict, but looking deeper, fighting the options and choices our mind secretly keeps alive, and asking where those alternatives come from.

## Choices

Awareness, or knowledge is the fundamental thing, not the effort, not the work. The one who is aware of what they're doing, and why they are doing what they are doing have a sense of effortlessness in their work and lives. They are nirvikalpa (not confused, not pulled by alternatives). 

Once you truly understand that, you can put in immense work, but it’ll feel effortless because deep down, you know this work is bound to happen. That knowing makes you nirvikalp (without inner alternatives)

Where there’s no alternative, there’s no mental struggle. All psychological pain comes from duality, from options, from inner friction. The moment your mind has two competing paths, suffering begins.

When you’re nirvikalp, you’re peaceful. You can make peace with any situation no matter how difficult it is, as you know it is what it is and all other routes have already closed. So what’s the point of resisting? Even to feel good or bad, you need comparison among choices, and what is comparison for a person who is nirvikalp, for whom there is no concept of "choice".

Effortlessness doesn’t mean there’s no physical work. It just means there’s no mental restlessness. The body and brain will still work hard, but the mind isn’t struggling anymore. Work stops when physical limits arrive, not mental ones. A Nishkam Karmi works intensely, not because they seek pleasure, but because pleasure has become irrelevant. They seek Truth.

## Illusion of No Choice

This is not a discipline question. I'm not asking to hide the choices your mind has developed. Face them. Most of the morally driven and disciplined people struggle daily as they are actually in a quiet conflict. 

If your mind has developed a conception that drinking alcohol "might" give me pleasure, but you refuse to drink it in name of morality or discipline, don't call this being Nirvikalp. 

To end it, face it, maybe for once drink it and ask yourself, can it lead me to fulfilment? Can it take me closer to the truth? If not, you'll probably kill this option for next time and can make a step towards being Nirvikalp, not by suppressing the choice, but by understanding it.

## The root of restlessness

We are dissatisfied with ourselves, and everything in nature is a reflection of that dissatisfaction. The ego never finds satisfaction in the world, though it does find safety in it, and hence it is scared to go closer to the truth.  

We are not fully content, we all crave contentment. That’s why no one can sit idle without acting. The mistake begins when we start searching for satisfaction in the reflection, in the world outside us. This is what is called the process of ordinary desire: looking for peace, fullness, or meaning in the external world. Chasing money, buying cars, hitting the gym to look better are some of the few attempts people do. 

But the world isn’t something separate from us. And what we’re truly seeking is something different from us - the Truth. So how could we ever find it in something that’s basically our own shadow?

The search for completeness in the material world always fails.

When we act with the hope of finding fulfillment or peace in the results, that’s Sakam Karma, action driven by desire.

Now I'm not asking you to leave the world and go sit on a mountain and say the nature is all false. Use nature as a path to achieve mastery while understanding whatever materialistic thing this nature has to offer won't lead to fulfilment.

When we act without that craving, when the intent is not to squeeze satisfaction from the world but to transcend the world, that’s Nishkam Karma.
The world then stops being the goal, and simply becomes the medium. Not the end, but the path.

## Mastery

Einstein didn’t study time to win a Nobel Prize. Leonardo da Vinci didn't study nature for society to call him a genius. They studied it because they couldn’t not do it. The idea gripped them so deeply that the choice of not pursuing it simply didn’t exist. That’s what being Nirvikalp means, choiceless action born out of inner clarity.

When action flows from that space, it generally becomes Nishkam Karma. There’s effort, but no restlessness. Work continues, but the mind stays still. The outcome stops mattering, because the process itself becomes sacred.

Masters don’t act to reach somewhere, they act because action itself becomes their expression of truth. They don’t need results to validate them, the act of doing is the fulfillment.

## Dissatisfaction

Dissatisfaction doesn’t exist when your actions are truly Nishkam, i.e. free from attachment to the result.

That doesn’t mean “be content with everything” or “do nothing.” That’s against the very spirit of this. It’s not about being happy anywhere. If that were the goal, Krishna would’ve told Arjun to just walk away from the battlefield and meditate in the jungle, be happy anywhere.

The question is: whatever you’re doing, is it being done out of your ego, or for Krishna, the Truth, the Higher self? If it’s ego driven, stop, it can't give you fulfilment. If it’s aligned with Truth, go on. That’s where real contentment lies.

## Love

Love, in its purest form, is the most natural example of Nishkam Karma. You don’t love to get something back. You love because that’s your nature in that moment. If it’s real, you don’t even think of alternatives. You don’t weigh the pros and cons of loving, you just do. That’s what makes it Nirvikalp, choiceless, effortless, yet all consuming. The artists who lose track of time, the founders who build without knowing if it’ll work.

They act with intensity, but without attachment. They fail, but they don’t crumble. They succeed, but they don’t lose themselves. Because for them, the act itself is the reward.

When love or passion is pure, it doesn’t create conflict, it ends it. You stop asking, “Should I keep going?” and start feeling, “I can’t not do this.” That’s Nirvikalp. That’s freedom from the inner tug of options.

Love the process.

## Framework

Eliminating choices is a big task but will always be followed if you completely internalise and face the root cause of the choices you feel. It feels tricky if can’t even clearly list down the choices our mind has made, let alone try to eliminate them. It requires immense focus and that's why ordinary people stay mediocre and conflicted.
