Humans race will do every possible effort to try to save itself, iff they can do so while making money. I read this somewhere, don’t remember where. Maybe I would have remembered if someone had paid me to remember it. 

But this is so true, you can see the surface level progressions like cutting the trees or pollution. But human race never even dares to consider it an option to halt the nature destruction to save itslef (I mean stopping the factories, cars and even the internet) because that would mean losing money. 

So, naturally, the next rabbit hole is obvious: what even is this thing called “money” and how did it get such god-level powers over us? How did it become so fundamental even to our existence? How did it worm its way so deep into our systems that nobody can even think of taking it out?

//Barter system
Barter system was the thing earlier. People used to exchange stuff on their instincts. I imagine in this kind of system, people would have been more generous as they would be sharing stuff. 

//did money come first or people started living in colonies? work assigned to them?

Earlier we used precious metals, precious implies that they were rare so obviously they were a store of value as they are now,
Scarcity increases the value as we know. 
But, we used to use that store of value as money or currency as a medium for exchange. That came with a couple of problems, first was to shred them in smaller pieces, which was in itself a challenge. Secondly, a bigger issue was forging, means how will you identify counterfeit and real metal. People used to put it on flame etc. and judged visually which was a cumbersome  process with high friction.

And so, validation and centralisation are very related. 
The cost and risk of validating that the metals are real, caused people to outsource the validation from a third party first of all in form of coins and later in form of bank notes. Means, they took help of a third party, who made coins with characteristic feature that is hard to forge and ensured the relative purity of gold or copper or silver that the coins were made up of. Till here, the game depended mostly on the scarcity of metal and trust on authority, but later that trust increased disproportionately, maybe due to political reasons that people blindly trusted the third party or authority that they published paper notes, which clearly implies that it was not silver or gold which was of worth, it was the stamp of third party that carried all the worth. (which was obv governments or kingdoms etc). So when such people become some big that their literal signature or stamp can make a paper worth real shit, then they tend to abuse the trust. 

To overcome the abuse, initially, there was a consensus that the currencies were pegged by the gold that a country or kingdom had. You cannot just print money, if your gold reserves don't allow. Then there came a notion of fiat currency that we use today, which was that the governments become so trusted that they don't the currency to anything, it just the trust or the promise. If you read a RBI banknote, it states a promise.

Now when organisations become so big, problems and natural. And those problems are problems of trust



### Definition of Money
It's worth just starting with like what is money if you ask 10 people on the street what money is you probably get 10 different answers sure so I think it's important just be rigorous about that and if you 
ask a lawyer you'll get an answer that's radically different than if you ask an economist as well if you ask a lawyer they'll say something like an official government currency so of course bitcoin and gold you can't write checks for those because those are not legal official government currencies so that's the that's the kind of neuro modern legal definition
 economists: use the definition of medium of exchange which is a much broader definition but that also assumes it you know the only important transactions are people exchanging things which in our modern economy is a good assumption but if you actually go back to the origins of money which I've liked to study I'm you find things like inheritance and compensation for injuries as equivalent to a modern lawsuit but not necessarily with governments and courts more like Wars to enforce the force of the verdict and Bridewell there's certain fitness critical critical to Darwinian fitness that other animals can't do the humans can and that form of I like to call it collectibles because not have  extended the definition money far broader than probably any economist would want to but so I out calls collectible.

> Unit of exchange. How many loafs of bread a car costs? Barter

>Bitcoin and gold as a store of value.

>Money is a bubble that never bursts.

>What makes a currency valuable (in terms of money maybe):
-Scarcity
-Easy to use and transport


if I send you money from my computer to your computer we're really relying on Visa and the banks and a bunch of intermediaries just actually say yes the money got to you and the money is no longer mine but computers don't like 
to operate like that computers you know computer code especially stuff that's running in the cloud on its own shouldn't have to rely on an offline wet space meatspace institution to enforce that kind of thing
